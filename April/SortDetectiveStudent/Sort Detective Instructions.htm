      <H3 align=left>Objective</H3>
      <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary objective of this lab 
      is for you to apply your theoretical knowledge of sorting algorithms to 
      solve a problem of poor user interface design.&nbsp; More specifically, 
      you will be given a program which is designed to measure comparisons, data 
      movements, and execution time for the seven sorting algorithms discussed 
      in class.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the designer of the program did not label 
      the buttons properly.&nbsp; You must apply your understanding of the 
      general properties of the algorithms (and in some cases of the code used 
      to implement them) to determine the proper labeling of the buttons.
      <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The secondary objective of this lab 
      is for you to gain experience writing a concise, but complete analysis of 
      a system.
      <H3 align=left>Background</H3>
      <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you know from class, if you 
      double the size of the data set that you give to a quadratic algorithm, it 
      will do four times the work; by contrast, an O(NlogN) algorithm will do a 
      bit more than twice as much; and, a linear algorithm will do only twice as 
      much work.&nbsp; As you also know, the characteristics of the input data 
      set can affect the expected performance of many of our sorting 
      algorithms.&nbsp; Before you begin the lab, you should review the expected 
      performance of the algorithms on various data sets.
      <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sorting algorithms under study 
      this week include (in alphabetical order): bubbleSort, heapSort, 
      insertionSort, mergeSort, quickSort, selectionSort, and shellSort.
      <H3 align=left>Instructions - Warning: read all of the instructions before 
      beginning!</H3>
      <OL>
        <LI>
        <P align=left>Begin by copying the SortDetective application from the 
        server.&nbsp; Execute it and play with it a bit.&nbsp; Notice that the 
        button names do not give any indication which sort they will 
        execute.&nbsp; Notice also, that if you create a small list, then that 
        list is shown to you in the console window.&nbsp; In the unlikely event 
        that a sort fails (oops!), a message will appear there as well.<BR></P>
        <LI>
        <P align=left>Devise a plan which will enable you to match the 
        particular algorithms to the button names.&nbsp; Hint:&nbsp; It may make 
        sense to try to divide the sorts into initial groups and then to work on 
        each group separately.&nbsp; Divide and conquer: it works for algorithms 
        and it can work here, too!<BR></P>
        <LI>
        <P align=left>Execute your plan, taking careful notes as you go.<BR></P>
        <LI>
        <P align=left>Describe the results of your experiment in a summary 
        document.&nbsp; Begin with a summary of the matching and then show the 
        rationalization process that justifies it.&nbsp; A sample from a similar 
        (but much simpler) lab on searching can be seen <A

      <H3>A Note on Writing</H3>
      <P class=Question 
      style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; tab-stops: .5in"><SPAN 
      style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>There is no 
      coding in this lab.&nbsp; Thus, you should expect that a 
      <B>significant</B> portion of the lab grade for this lab will be 
      determined by the quality of the writing of the report.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This includes the completeness of 
      the report, the clarity (and grammar) of the writing, and general 
      presentation.&nbsp; In the past, some students who matched all seven sorts 
      correctly have received poor grades due to sloppy writing. Don't be one of 
      them! </P>
      <P class=Question 
      style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; tab-stops: .5in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Some of the sorts are very difficult to distinguish.&nbsp; A carefully 
      outlined experiment may compensate for an error in these cases if the 
      writing makes it clear that your conclusions/guesses are substantiated by 
      the data.</P>
      <P class=Question 
      style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; tab-stops: .5in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Finally, remember that your report needn't detail every experiment you 
      ran.&nbsp; Rather, it should give sufficient information to justify your 
      conclusions.&nbsp; It is possible to write a very short report that is 
      completely correct if your experiments are well-chosen.&nbsp; After you 
      learn the matching, you might consider whether there was a shorter way to 
      arrive at your conclusion!</P>
